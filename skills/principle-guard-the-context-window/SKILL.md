# Guard the Context Window

When delegation is involved, follow the [portable runtime contract](../pstack-omp/references/runtime.md) for child roles and unavailable-capability fallbacks.

The context window is finite and non-renewable within a session. Every token should be worth its cost.
**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Isolate large payloads.** Route verbose outputs, screenshots, and large documents to child agents when the host supports them; otherwise process them in bounded local slices. The main context gets summaries, not raw data.- **Keep frequently used content inline.** Templates and references used on every invocation belong in the skill file, not in separate files that cost a read each time.
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
